# Parametric Optimization using Machine Learning


## TODO

- [x] Rewrite functions so that they get `lb` and `ub` so that there is no need to change the input arguments for `b`


### Inventory Control
- OK - Rewrite problem as MathProgBase form: https://mathprogbasejl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lpqcqp.html
- OK Fix basis computation and solve using the functions in extract_basis.jl and learn_basis.jl
- OK Finish Inventory control example

- [ ] Try more realistic LP with parameters
  - [ ] Reasonable parameters influence (linear interaction?)
  - [ ] Reasonable size
